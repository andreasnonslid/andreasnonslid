# Hi there, I'm Andreas Nonslid Håvardsen👋

I'm an Embedded Engineer currently working at AutoStore AS, programming MCUs primarily using C and C++.

## Professional (in order of use)
- C / C++ (w/ CMake)
- Python
- Bash
- Typescript + Javascript

## Hobby (in order of use)
- Golang
- Lua
- AutoHotkey (v1 and v2) (probably never again)
- Perl (probably never again)

Listing everything I've had a week/month long attraction to would 10x the list. That is not informative, so you're welcome.

Would use Rust more if I didn't literally get payed for writing C++ which I can just use instead :)

## My current setup
- openSUSE Tumbleweed / WSL for it on work laptop
- Ghostty / or Windows Terminal on work laptop
- bash
- Neovim
